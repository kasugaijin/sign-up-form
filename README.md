# sign-up-form
This sign-up form was built using html and css and uses javascript to validate the second password entry equals the first before allowing the user to submit their information. This is typical of many forms in use online today and demonstrates understanding of page structure, styling and data validation. 

Note this was not designed for mobile screens. While the layout is responsive to screen size, it retains minimum dimensions to preserve the layout. Mobile development was not the goal of this project.
